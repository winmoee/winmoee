- I am Win, an international student from Myanmar, a freshman studying computer science at UC Berkeley.
- Technology has been invaluable to my upbringing and I have been fortunate to have used the internet to access a vast ocean of educational materials.
- I hope to gain experience in software development and enterprise and eventually transfer that knowledge back to my country.
